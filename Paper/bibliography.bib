@article{Duffy1997beauty,
 abstract = {We report and compare results from several different versions of an experimental interactive guessing game first studied by Nagel (1995), which we refer to as the `beauty contest' game following Keynes (1936). In these games, groups of subjects are repeatedly asked to simultaneously guess a real number in the interval [ 0, 100] that they believe will be closest to 1/2 times either the median, mean, or maximum of all numbers chosen. We also use our experimental data to test a simple model of adaptive learning behaviour.},
